## Hey, I'm Niels 👋

  **Principal PM, Growth at Picsart** — I build AI-powered systems that help products grow to millions of users.

  ### What I Do

  I've scaled products to 10M+ users twice — not by growing teams, but by building smart systems. Currently at Picsart (150M+ users), where I've 3X'd web traffic to 20M MAU while freeing up time for the work that actually matters.

  **My approach**: Build systems that let small teams punch way above their weight.

  ### AI-Powered Growth in Practice

  - **50+ tools shipped in 1 year** with just 2 engineers — built a framework that let us ship 2 complete flows/week
  - **Page creation: 2 hours → 5 minutes** — N8N + LLMs handle the repetitive stuff so we can focus on strategy
  - **40+ languages, 2,000+ pages** — built a localization system that scales with us as we grow
  - **LP conversion: 5% → 65%** — AI-assisted optimization and rapid experimentation

  ### What I Build With

  Automation    → N8N, Zapier, Claude Code, custom scripts
  
  AI/LLMs       → Claude, GPT-4, custom prompts for content generation
  
  Analytics     → Looker, GA4, Amplitude
  
  SEO/AEO       → Ahrefs API, GSC, Semrush, Profound
  
  Product       → Figma, Strapi CMS, JIRA

  ### Background

  Started in marketing (festivals, e-commerce, NGOs) → Product at NU.nl (Netherlands' #1 news app, 8M users) → Enterprise SaaS at Whisbi (Fortune 500 clients) → Growth at Picsart.

  Been excited about AI since 2018 when we shipped AI-generated audio news at NU.nl — super fun to see it is now the default for everything we do. 

  ### Currently Exploring

  - AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) — getting cited by AI search
  - Agentic workflows for product teams
  - Programmatic content at scale
  - AI-assisted experimentation
