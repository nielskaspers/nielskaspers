# Niels here 👋

I turn **AI** into **usable design tools** — the kind you can clone today and ship this week.

I care about two things:
1) making **creative workflows** faster without losing taste, and  
2) giving developers **clear, working patterns** (not vibes).

---

## The 30-second version

- **I build** layout-aware AI agents and visual workflows (canvas helpers, style guidance, asset-aware edits).
- **I share** ready-to-run examples so teams can skip boilerplate and get straight to building.
- **I avoid** generic “AI image generator” rabbit holes and focus on **design features** that land in real products.

---

## What I ship

- 🧠 **AI Design Agents**  
  Single + multi-agent setups, canvas/browser agents, style-guided flows, local & cloud runners.

- 📦 **Starters you can run**  
  `git clone` → `install` → `run`. Clean repos with env templates, scripts, and examples.

- 🔧 **Developer/workflow patterns**  
  Tool calling, logging & eval, planning, prompt+style ops, guardrails, brand-safe constraints.

- 🗂️ **Visual retrieval (RAG-for-assets)**  
  Hybrid search across images/vectors/metadata, brand kits, style tokens, boards & libraries.

- 🎨 **Design features**  
  Generative fill/expand, object/background edits, smart resize/variants, prompt-to-layout.

- 💬 **Chat-with-your-assets**  
  Talk to brand libraries, docs, and media; generate on-brand visuals and content.

- 🧩 **Code-first examples**  
  Minimal templates for modern SDKs/APIs; no framework lock-in, no mystery glue.

---

## How I work (principles)

- **Show, don’t tell.** Every pattern comes with a runnable example.  
- **Small to real.** Start from a minimal path; graduate to production-minded structure.  
- **Taste > noise.** Guardrails and style systems matter as much as model choice.  
- **Own your stack.** Local where it helps, cloud where it counts.

---
